 <h1>About</h1><br> 
 <p>Hi, My name is Alexis but you can call me Briana. I was born and raised in North Carolina. I now reside in Rolesville,NC with my babygirl  Genesis. My current age is:</p>
 <p id="age"></p>
 <script>
    let x = myFunction(5, 5);
    document.getElementById("age").innerHTML = x;

    function myFunction(a, b) {
      return a * b;
    }
    </script>  
    <p>The reason and purpose of me deciding to do a personal vision board website was to:</p>
    <p id="vision"></p>

<script>
const dreams = ["Have a visual of what my reality will be in the future.", "Create goals to acclompish.", "Motivate myself to elevate everyday.", "Give my daughter a promising future.", "Gradually practice positivity and learn new things.", "Have a healthy work life balance."];
let text="";
for (let i = 0; i < dreams.length; i++) {
  text += dreams[i] + "<br>";
}
document.getElementById("vision").innerHTML = text;
</script>
<p id="website"></p>
<script>
    const insight = new Date().getHours();
    let greeting;
    if (insight > 40) {
      greeting = "Thank you for taking time to visit!";
    } else if (insight < 500) {
      greeting = "Theres more to explore!";
    } else {
      greeting = "Thanks for visiting my website!";
    }
    document.getElementById("website").innerHTML = greeting;
    </script>
